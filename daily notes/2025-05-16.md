# Notes

* *00:28* **:**   the only animal that isn't reminded with some regularity of how its blood looks on a body of its species when it leaks and pools and trickles and mats the hair and gilds the skin and glazes the lips is an animal in captivity. incidentally depression and self mutilation are behaviours only exhibited in a pathological nature by captive animals
* one is not brought to remember the staggeringly incandescent shade of the material through which he puppets himself except by endangering the control he has

* *15:40* **:**
