### Notes

* *14:45* **:**   i hate the awkward lucidity
* screaming the words to a song the type of screaming that doesn’t pretend to pass for singing nor that’s screamed just because the song is playing but the type of screaming enunciation that people would count as a symptom of some vague psychopathology and a scream that means to embody the very fact that the lyrics mean something 
* and then while you’re baring your soul to the still air, to schrodingers scrutiny, to the simple and confounding audience of no one but your self and crying to no one but your self you realise you should focus now for the right turn coming up and there’s still here no one but your self but you feel an absence that wasn’t there before  

* *16:31* **:**
