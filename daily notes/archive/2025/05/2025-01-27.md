### Notes



*09:05* **:**   i will never hate kanye west and i will also never refer to him by anything but his birth name

*10:14* **:** smashing pumpkins is timeless asf

*12:27* **:** tatted asf. stung lowkey. the tattooist Brooke described it as feeling like cat scratches mixed with sunburn. she was a nice lady. apparently i have very good skin for tattooing. the barbers also say i have very good hair for buzzing and fading. maybe i was born to be a biker. or a version of jackie jr aprile from the sopranos except 5’7, from the other side of the mediterranean, not a dropout, and not get himself killed


*12:33* **:**   fucking idiot woman had the gall to get all passive pissy in the elevator because she wanted to go down but it started going up as was indicated by the fucking arrow pointing up that lit up when the door opened which she didn’t bother to fucking check
