### Notes


*12:17* **:** woke up too late god damn.

*12:17* **:**   it takes a cold shower to realise how warm your body is just from being alive 
*12:18* **:**  a mf will pine over notoriously unreliable performance cars that cost blood and tears just to keep running, but will not 
*14:51* **:** invest any money or effort into being a high performance human. further, he will feel disgruntled and upset at his body when it fails under pressure 

*14:53* **:**   i really want a pair of black lens silver metal frame circular sunnies because i have an image in my head of samuel l jackson or someone that looks a lot like him rocking them in a movie 

*18:33* **:**   it wasnâ€™t samuel l jackson it was lawrence fishburne and it was from the fucking matrix and this was the exact photo in my head except it was in black and white ![[Pasted image 20250131183606.jpg]]
