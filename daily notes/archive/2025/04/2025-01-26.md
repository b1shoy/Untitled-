### Notes


*14:15* **:**   hot water immersion 

*14:19* **:**   allow to sleep; ensure she’s responsive; you have to wake her up if she doesn’t stir in response to touch or sound

*14:23* **:**   poison info line: 131126
hold off on creams or ointments until examined by doctor

*17:47* **:**   this bitch nearly barrelled into me with her e scooter and i said sorry but i wasn’t really sorry because there’s literally a sign saying none scooters on the fucking footpath where real people walk and i want to go back and see elk her i’m not actually sorry because you’re wrong for
