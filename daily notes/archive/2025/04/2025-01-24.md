### Notes



*15:00* **:** woke up at 5 to noon. took my meds, had a slice of pizza, took a shit. been hitting the vape and biting my fingers and nails. been reading; broke 31% on junky. realising that i relate to bill a little more than i would like to on the topic of realising how you have a habit.





*19:41* **:** itâ€™s so easy to drink enough that you lose basic functionality but its so hard to drin k eough that you feel like youve drank enough

*23:44* **:**   just finished junky. interesting book. one u certainly dont read for the ends of a fulfilling story or to gain a piece of insight you know you want because whatever you get from this book will be something you didn't know you wanted.
