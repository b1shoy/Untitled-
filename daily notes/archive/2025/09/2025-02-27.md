### Notes

* *10:22* **:**   creating symmetry is an active endeavour. at the same time, more often than not, the case is that symmetry is belied by extraneity. to create something perfect out of something greater in quantity is to wield a straight razor like a pen

* *10:26* **:**   in this way, when a person feels themselves to be spent and exhausted it’s because they’ve been using the same “blade” for too long trimming back the relentless growth of the outside world into their life.

* *10:31* **:**   to replace the blade means to restructure your Self. and you will do so on and on until you’re too old and your hands too shaky and then you become part of the incumbent vegetation of the earth and you had best hope you raised a kid that likes you enough to keep you in their clearance like a potted withering palm tree.

* *11:28* **:**
