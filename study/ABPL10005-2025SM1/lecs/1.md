## the construction industry
* construction industry characteristics
	* the physical nature of the product
		* makes it unique to other industries
	* normally manufactured on the construction site
	* projects are typically one-off designs
	* design is separated from the manufacturing process
	* produces investment products rather than consumer products/goods
	* activities affected by weather
	* small number of large firms; large number of small firms
		* small firms concentrate on repair & maintenance; larger firms handle original construction projects
* national and financial importance
	* vital part of australia's economy: *approx 8% of GDP*
	* worth **$360bn**+ per year
	* economic multiplier: *all industries interact* in order to build and maintain physical assets
	* comprises over 360,000 businesses; **most registered businesses of any industry**
	* **employs approx 1mil people; 9% of workforce**
	* critical to attracting investment in new resource and manufacturing projects
	* GDP contribution illustrated
		* ![[Pasted image 20250311131200.png]]
	* **multiplier effect:**
		* for every 1m of output, creates the following jobs in the following industries:
			* 9 construction
			* 7 manufacturing
			* 21 misc
			* other economic output increases by *$2.9m*
* case study: coles' expansion
	* coles invests *$1.1bn* to open 70 new stores over 3 years
		* creating *16,000 jobs*
			* 8.5k FTE positions
			* 8.2k construction jobs
