## what the culture industry is
### what is culture
* raymond williams (1958):
	* "culture" is a "whole way of life" which *represents the known meanings and directions which its members recognize and respond to*.
	* not just what may be considered « high art » or « artistic » but also the mundane of the everyday
y65
### *the culture industry* 
* a term used by adorno and horkheimer to **describe** how, in a capitalist society, **popular culture functions like an industry that produces standardized products** for, and in order to produce, ***standardized people***. 
* they theorise that:
	* all culture (artistic and mundane) has become commercialised
	* culture *can no longer be distinguished from economic production*
	* culture is *systematically produced and imposed upon the population
	* the media plays a crucial role in the industrialisation of culture
## role of the media in the culture industry
* “it is claimed that standards [of culture] *were* based in the first place on consumers’ needs, and for that reason were accepted with so little resistance. *The result is the circle of manipulation and retroactive need in which the unity of the system grows ever stronger*. No mention is made of the fact that **the basis on which technology acquires power over society is the power of those whose economic hold over society is greatest**. [that is why] A technological rationale is the rationale of domination itself.” `Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33` 

“From every sound film and every broadcast programme the social effect can be inferred which is exclusive to none but is shared by all alike.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=BX7KDHKT))

> [!heat] ***SUPPOSED limitation of adorno & horkheimer***'s culture industry theory
> >[!tip] Adorno and Horkheimer neglect *what was to become central to cultural studies*: the ways that the culture industry, **while in the service of organized capital, also provides the opportunities for all kinds of individual and collective creativity and decoding.**
