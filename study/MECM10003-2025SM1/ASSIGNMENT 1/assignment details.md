Provide a **1000-word** *critical evaluation* of a key *concept or approach* in Media Studies *covered in Block 1* of this subject (weeks 2-5). For example, you might choose to analyse Marshall McLuhan’s concept of ‘the medium is the message’, or Gill and Orgad’s move from a critique of sexualisation to power relations in media representation. You are required to:

1. Provide a summary of your chosen concept or approach;
2. Critically evaluate its values and/or limitations; and
3. Apply it to a real-world example/case study (such as a social/political event, online phenomenon, or a development in the media and communication industries) to help demonstrate your understanding of the concept. Hypothetical narration will not be accepted.

This assessment does not require you to do independent scholarly research, but you must cite and engage with the relevant required reading(s). You may also discuss and engage with relevant secondary readings and recommended readings if you wish.
