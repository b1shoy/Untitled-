“a society that has lost its capacity to nourish true freedom and individuality – as well as the ability to represent the real conditions of existence” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=1&annotation=UQHQCMPQ))

“believe that this loss results from the fact that cultural production has moved from an artisanal stage, which depended on individual effort and required little or no investment, to an industrial stage.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=1&annotation=M8HJZAM2))

“representing “average” life for purposes of pure entertainment or distraction as seductively and realistically as possible” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=1&annotation=KM4CL2AG))

“different only at the most superficial level” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=1&annotation=YGYZENHI))

“Hitler’s totalitarianism (with its state control of cultural production) and the American market system are fused in their thought” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=1&annotation=TP2J66D7))

“Even the aesthetic activities of political opposites are one in their enthusiastic obedience to the rhythm of the iron system” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=2&annotation=WPQGVM36))

“Under monopoly all mass culture is identical, and the lines of its artificial framework begin to show through” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=2&annotation=NWCMCZP4))

“They call themselves industries; and when their directors’ incomes are published, any doubt about the social utility of the finished products is removed.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=2&annotation=G9XS95KR))

“33” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=MNPK5R2H))

“it is claimed that standards were based in the first place on consumers’ needs, and for that reason were accepted with so little resistance. The result is the circle of manipulation and retroactive need in which the unity of the system grows ever stronger. No mention is made of the fact that the basis on which technology acquires power over society is the power of those whose economic hold over society is greatest. A technological rationale is the rationale of domination itself.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=8ILMSC7F))

“But any trace of spontaneity from the public in official broadcasting is controlled and absorbed by talent scouts, studio competitions and official programmes of every kind selected by professionals.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=6Z5UDJYT))

“The attitude of the public, which ostensibly and actually favours the system of the culture industry, is a part of the system and not an excuse for it.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=RN7ZFCNY))

“We are closer to the facts if we explain these phenomena as inherent in the technical and personnel apparatus which, down to its last cog, itself forms part of the economic mechanism of selection” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=KEEIEVB5))

“agreement – or at least the determination – of all executive authorities not to produce or sanction anything that in any way differs from their own rules, their own ideas about consumers, or above all themselves.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=63CYE94B))

“In our age the objective social tendency is incarnate in the hidden subjective purposes of company directors” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=3&annotation=VC7N9NUP))

“The dependence of the most powerful broadcasting company on the electrical industry, or of the motion picture industry on the banks, is characteristic of the whole sphere, whose individual branches are themselves economically interwoven” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=96F6HDH5))

“All are in such close contact that the extreme concentration of mental forces allows demarcation lines between different firms and technical branches to be ignored” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=V2V2LYGP))

“The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=YXCTMZUD))

“Market differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organizing, and labelling consumers.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=B7BPKX4I))

“Something is provided for all so that none may escape; the distinctions are emphasized and extended.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=ULZ8BD3M))

“The public is catered for with a hierarchical range of mass-produced products of varying quality, thus advancing the rule of complete quantification. Everybody must behave (as if spontaneously) in accordance with his previous determined and indexed level, and choose the category of mass product turned out for his type.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=ZX57CCHR))

“How formalized the procedure is can be seen when the mechanically differentiated products prove to be all alike in the end.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=XIN4FS46))

“That the difference between the Chrysler range and General Motors products is basically illusory strikes every child with a keen interest in varieties. What connoisseurs discuss as good or bad points serve only to perpetuate the semblance of competition and range of choice. The same applies to the Warner Brothers and Metro Goldwyn Mayer productions.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=TX43UXJG))

“even the differences between the more expensive and cheaper models put out by the same firm steadily diminish” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=F6QRIBS2))

“The universal criterion of merit is the amount of ‘conspicuous production’ of blatant cash investment.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=MXDPAEIT))

“but its consequences will be quite enormous and promise to intensify the impoverishment of aesthetic matter so drastically, that by tomorrow the thinly veiled identity of all industrial culture products can come triumphantly out into the open, derisively fulfilling the Wagnerian dream of the Gesamtkunstwerk – the fusion of all the arts in one work.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=4&annotation=626AANCV))

“The old experience of the movie-goer, who sees the world outside as an extension of the film he has just left (because the latter is intent upon reproducing the world of everyday perceptions), is now the producer’s guideline.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=CJK29VN6))

“The more intensely and flawlessly his techniques duplicate empirical objects, the easier it is today for the illusion to prevail that the outside world is the straightforward continuation of that presented on the screen” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=PGS2RTTU))

“Real life is becoming indistinguishable from the movies. The sound film, far surpassing the theatre of illusion, leaves no room for imagination or reflection on the part of the audience, who are unable to respond within the structure of the film, yet deviate from its precise detail without losing the thread of the story” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=DTXHV6V3))

“The stunting of the massmedia consumer’s powers of imagination and spontaneity does not have to be traced back to any psychological mechanisms; he must ascribe the loss of those attributes to the objective nature of the products themselves, especially to the most characteristic of them, the sound film. They are so designed that quickness, powers of observation, and experience are undeniably needed to apprehend them at all; yet sustained thought is out of the question if the spectator is not to miss the relentless rush of facts.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=QJXC9DHT))

“They are so designed that quickness, powers of observation, and experience are undeniably needed to apprehend them at all; yet sustained thought is out of the question if the spectator is not to miss the relentless rush of facts.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=3SNPNMYQ))

“The might of industrial society is lodged in men’s minds. The entertainments manufacturers know that their products will be consumed with alertness even when the customer is distraught, for each of them is a model of the huge economic machinery which has always sustained the masses, whether at work or at leisure which is akin to work.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=WLL3C4ZK))

“From every sound film and every broadcast programme the social effect can be inferred which is exclusive to none but is shared by all alike.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=BX7KDHKT))

“The stereotyped appropriation of everything, even the inchoate, for the purposes of mechanical reproduction surpasses the rigour and general currency of any ‘real style’, in the sense in which cultural cognoscenti celebrate the organic precapitalist past.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=5&annotation=5S6WZV56))

“The explicit and implicit, exoteric and esoteric catalogue of the forbidden and tolerated is so extensive that it not only defines the area of freedom but is allpowerful inside it.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=HJYURRQR))

“The constant pressure to produce new effects (which must conform to the old pattern) serves merely as another rule to increase the power of the conventions when any single effect threatens to slip through the net.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=IX3C2BMU))

“Every detail is so firmly stamped with sameness that nothing can appear which is not marked at birth, or does not meet with approval at first sight. And the star performers, whether they produce or reproduce, use this jargon as freely and fluently and with as much gusto as if it were the very language which it silenced long ago.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=UHVV57RP))

“Such is the ideal of what is natural in this field of activity, and its influence becomes all the more powerful, the more technique is perfected and diminishes the tension between the finished product and everyday life.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=H8K96SKU))

“A jazz musician who is playing a piece of serious music, one of Beethoven’s simplest minuets, syncopates it involuntarily and will smile superciliously when asked to follow the normal divisions of the beat. This is the ‘nature’ which, complicated by the ever-present and extravagant demands of the specific medium, constitutes the new style and is a ‘system of non-culture, to which one might even concede a certain “unity of style” if it really made any sense to speak of stylized barbarity’.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=RUMGJVNB))

“Whenever Orson Welles offends against the tricks of the trade, he is forgiven because his departures from the norm are regarded as calculated mutations which serve all the more strongly to confirm the validity of the system.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=LWYQTZVI))

“The constraint of the technically conditioned idiom which stars and directors have to produce as ‘nature’ so that the people can appropriate it, extends to such fine nuances that they almost attain the subtlety of the devices of an avant-garde work as against those of truth.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=KLFMSRPE))

“The rare capacity minutely to fulfil the obligations of the natural idiom in all branches of the culture industry becomes the criterion of efficiency” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=6&annotation=DUXNZ7PP))

“overreached the culturally conservative distinction between genuine and artificial style.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=BQEBBSYU))

“A style might be called artificial which is imposed from without on the refractory impulses of a form. But in the culture industry every element of the subject matter has its origin in the same apparatus as that jargon whose stamp it bears” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=VD6UZ6WK))

“The reputation of the specialist, in which a last remnant of objective independence sometimes finds refuge, conflicts with the business politics of the church, or the concern which is manufacturing the cultural commodity.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=N7HYUHWT))

“Hence the style of the culture industry, which no longer has to test itself against any refractory material, is also the negation of style.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=QWY29XBP))

“The reconciliation of the general and particular, of the rule and the specific demands of the subject matter, the achievement of which alone gives essential, meaningful content to style, is futile because there has ceased to be the slightest tension between opposite poles: these concordant extremes are dismally identical; the general can replace the particular, and vice versa” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=W7MH3GT3))

“In the culture industry the notion of genuine style is seen to be the aesthetic equivalent of domination.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=W44GATTN))

“The unity of style not only of the Christian Middle Ages but of the Renaissance expresses in each case the different structure of social power, and not the obscure experience of the oppressed in which the general was enclosed.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=JRUKZPKQ))

“The great artists were never those who embodied a wholly flawless and perfect style, but those who used style as a way of hardening themselves against the chaotic expression of suffering, as a negative truth.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=FW2DGZNG))

“As late as Schoenberg and Picasso, the great artists have retained a mistrust of style, and at crucial points have subordinated it to the logic of the matter.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=EJZXE7SG))

“What Dadaists and Expressionists called the untruth of style as such triumphs today in the sung jargon of a crooner, in the carefully contrived elegance of a film star, and even in the admirable expertise of a photograph of a peasant’s squalid hut.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=TUN3CIIN))

“Style represents a promise in every work of art. That which is expressed is subsumed through style into the dominant forms of generality, into the language of music, painting, or words, in the hope that it will be reconciled thus with the idea of true generality” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=F3VETAMX))

“This promise held out by the work of art that it will create truth by lending new shape to the conventional social forms is as necessary as it is hypocritical. It unconditionally posits the real forms of life as it is by suggesting that fulfilment lies in their aesthetic derivatives.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=TCIHIET9))

“That factor in a work of art which enables it to transcend reality certainly cannot be detached from style; but it does not consist of the harmony actually” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=7&annotation=PUYVYZQH))

“realized, of any doubtful unity of form and content, within and without, of individual and society; it is to be found in those features in which discrepancy appears: in the necessary failure of the passionate striving for identity. Instead of exposing itself to this failure in which the style of the great work of art has always achieved self-negation, the inferior work has always relied on its similarity with others – on a surrogate identity.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=AWB5XM96))

“In the culture industry this imitation finally becomes absolute. Having ceased to be anything but style, it reveals the latter’s secret: obedience to the social hierarchy” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=6HBKEM5A))

“Culture as a common denominator already contains in embryo that schematization and process of cataloguing and classification which bring culture within the sphere of administration” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=HGKH5BZE))

“The promissory note which, with its plots and staging, it draws on pleasure is endlessly prolonged; the promise, which is actually all the spectacle consists of, is illusory: all it actually confirms is that the real point will never be reached, that the diner must be satisfied with the menu” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=BMQF8D32))

“The Hays Office [the film censor of the time] merely confirms the ritual of Tantalus that the culture industry has established anyway.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=6WRUGP6A))

“Love is downgraded to romance. And, after the descent, much is permitted; even licence as a marketable speciality has its quota bearing the trade description ‘daring’.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=FFTIIIBA))

“Because of his ubiquity, the film star with whom one is meant to fall in love is from the outset a copy of himself.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=8&annotation=S7AGWBSL))

“There is laughter because there is nothing to laugh at. Laughter, whether conciliatory or terrible, always occurs when some fear passes. It indicates liberation either from physical danger or from the grip of logic.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=9&annotation=X846C688))

The monastic theory that not asceticism but the sexual act denotes the renunciation of attainable bliss receives negative confirmation in the gravity of the lover who with foreboding commits his life to the fleeting moment.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=9&annotation=AXHTUTLA))

“In every product of the culture industry, the permanent denial imposed by civilization is once again unmistakably demonstrated and inflicted on its victims. To offer and to deprive them of something is one and the same. This is what happens in erotic films. Precisely because it must never take place, everything centres upon copulation. In films it is more strictly forbidden for an illegitimate relationship to be admitted without the parties being punished than for a millionaire’s future son-in-law to be active in the labour movement” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=9&annotation=9REFWN3T))

“Amusement, if released from every restraint, would not only be the antithesis of art but its extreme role.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=A7AJRBHL))

“Pure amusement in its consequence, relaxed self-surrender to all kinds of associations and happy nonsense, is cut short by the amusement on the market: instead, it is interrupted by a surrogate overall meaning which the culture industry insists on giving to its products, and yet misuses as a mere pretext for bringing in the stars.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=2GYTPHGZ))

“Biographies and other simple stories patch the fragments of nonsense into an idiotic plot. We do not have the cap and bells of the jester but the bunch of keys of capitalist reason, which even screens the pleasure of achieving success. Every kiss in the revue film has to contribute to the career of the boxer, or some hit song expert or other whose rise to fame is being glorified.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=8IDG7IDG))

“The culture industry is corrupt; not because it is a sinful Babylon but because it is a cathedral dedicated to elevated pleasure.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=PG5AVMIK))

“On all levels, from Hemingway to Emil Ludwig, from Mrs Miniver to the Lone Ranger, from Toscanini to Guy Lombardo, there is untruth in the intellectual content taken ready-made from art and science” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=H4JHFWDY))

“In the culture industry the individual is an illusion not merely because of the standardization of the means of production. He is tolerated only so long as his complete identification with the generality is unquestioned.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=10&annotation=ZVTX5ZZW))

“Every bourgeois characteristic, in spite of its deviation and indeed because of it, expressed the same thing: the harshness of the competitive society.” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=11&annotation=XJJGPS54))

“The individual who supported society bore its disfiguring mark; seemingly free, he was actually the product of its economic and social apparatus” ([Adorno and Horkheimer, 2007, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/Z3MCW7RR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZMNFW3CC?page=11&annotation=BP3RQF7K))
